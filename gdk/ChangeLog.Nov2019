- BATcalcbetween and all its variants now have an extra bool parameter
  "anti" to invert the test.

* Thu Apr 18 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- All forms of BATcalcbetween and VARcalcbetween have extra bool arguments
  for low inclusive, high inclusive and nils false.  The latter causes
  the result to be false instead of nil if the value being checked is nil.
