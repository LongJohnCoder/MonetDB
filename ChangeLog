- Added SQL function sql.hot_snapshot() which can be used to make write
  a snapshot of the database to a tar file. For example,
  sys.hot_snapshot('/tmp/snapshot.tar'). If compression support is
  compiled in, snapshots can also be compressed ('/tmp/snapshot.tar.gz').
  The tar file expands to a single directory with the same name as the
  database that was snapshotted. This directory can be passed directly
  as the --dbpath argument of mserver5.

- The MAL profiler now assigns the SQL TRACE output to the client record
  thereby avoiding the interaction with other queries, but loosing
  insight of competing queries. The stethoscope should be used for that.
