####technical depth####
Split the MOSadvance-like functions to type specific variant.
Create test for swapped join.
Add lots of tests with candidate lists for all
Add test for float/double
Add test for huge
Add test for default join and COUI case both in MAL and in SQL.
Be sure alignment is correct. Use asserts for this.
Check MOSanalysis and its test.
Fix/check/test MOSlayout.
Introduce mosaic into gdk: create hooks in scanselect functions/macro's, joins and projections.
benchmark using TPC-H
make mitosis work with mosaic and see how this relates to the previous landmark stuff.
Apply compressed operations more directly: on keys in dictionary compression (1)
Apply compressed operations more directly: on prefix|suffix in prefix compression (1)
Apply compressed operations more directly: on delta's and frame in frame compression (1)
consider packing mosaic_block_header's more efficiently.
Add asserts on type degeneration for bit => bte daytime => lng timestmap => lng date => int.
DO nil checking more efficient similar to gdk_select
Timing in the context of MOSanalysis

####code issues####
See if the iteration algorithms can be improved.
Get rid of (most of) MOStask and/or don't allocate it on the heap.
Make sure the parameters.bits fields are always char.
Use GDK naming conventions, e.g. o for stuff coming out if canditer_next.
Make block headers specific by having type parametrized blockheader struct's.
It is a bit cleaner if MOSadvance call's are done outside of select functions.
create a common header/source file for mosaic for common tasks e.g. to house a generic IS_NIL macro, IPtpe, etc.
Improve the administration of the various hard coded compression techniques, e.g. MOSskipit skip (2*)
