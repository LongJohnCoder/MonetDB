####technical depth####
null semantics plus tests
make sure candidate lists are working properly for select, theta_select and join
Use bit vectors more aggressively in mosaic_delta --- then resolve test mosaic_delta_timestamp --- and possibly other compression techniques as well.
Be sure alignment is correct. Use asserts for this.
consider packing mosaic_block_header's more efficiently.
Check MOSanalysis and its test.
Fix/check/test MOSlayout.
Add test for float/double
Add test for huge
delta compression: check if the hardcoded compression expression are correct. See also (2)
Add asserts on type degeneration for bit => bte daytime => lng timestmap => lng date => int.
See if we can re-introduce landmark stuff somehow.

####code issues####
Update copyright.
create dedicated type for bitvector internal type which is currently unsignned int. E.g. introduce #define BitVectorChunkType unsigned int.
move mask, bits, framebits from  MosaicHdr to MosaicBlkHeader_frame_t.
mosaic_delta.c: improve the macro's: for instance get rid of hardcoded expression arguments in DELTAcompress. (2*)
mosaic_<compression>.c: for type macro's use macro-wised inline functions.
Improve the administration of the various hard coded compression techniques. (2*)
