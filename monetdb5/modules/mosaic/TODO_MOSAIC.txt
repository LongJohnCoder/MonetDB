####technical depth####
make sure candidate lists are working properly (2)
Be sure alignment is correct. Use asserts for this.
Add test for float/double
Add test for huge
Check MOSanalysis and its test.
Fix/check/test MOSlayout.
make mitosis work with mosaic and see how this relates to the previous landmark stuff.
Remove floating point support in prefix compression and use prefix-like-frame semantics
Apply compressed operations more directly: on keys in dictionary compression (1)
Apply compressed operations more directly: on prefix|suffix in prefix compression (1)
Apply compressed operations more directly: on linear in prefix compression (1)
consider packing mosaic_block_header's more efficiently.
Add asserts on type degeneration for bit => bte daytime => lng timestmap => lng date => int.
benchmark

####code issues####
Refactor frame compressions code to be more inline with the other compression algortihm code.(1)
create a common header/source file for mosaic for common tasks e.g. to house a generic IS_NIL macro, IPtpe, etc.
mosaic_<compression>.c: for type macro's use macro-wised inline functions. (1)
Factor out more boilerplate code in various compression techniques. All compression follow similar patterns. (1*)
Improve the administration of the various hard coded compression techniques, e.g. MOSskipit skip (2*)
