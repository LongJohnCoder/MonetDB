####technical depth####
Be sure alignment is correct. Use asserts and type specialized block headers for this.(1*)
Check MOSanalysis and its test.
Fix/check/test MOSlayout.
Add negative values to tests
Add test for huge
create mix compression test cases.
Introduce mosaic into gdk: create hooks in scanselect functions/macro's, joins and projections.
benchmark using TPC-H
make mitosis work with mosaic and see how this relates to the previous landmark stuff.
Transform control dependency into data dependency select loops.
Apply compressed operations more directly: on constant value in runlength compression
Apply compressed operations more directly: on keys in dictionary compression
Apply compressed operations more directly: on prefix|suffix in prefix compression
Apply compressed operations more directly: on delta's and frame in frame compression
consider packing mosaic_block_header's more efficiently.
Add asserts on type degeneration for bit => bte daytime => lng timestmap => lng date => int.
DO nil checking more efficient similar to gdk_select
Timing in the context of MOSanalysis

####code issues####
# Improve macro code style: remove do_ from do_OPERATION-like macro's, NAME -> TECHNIQUE, small caps technique identifier -> CAPITAL CAPS technique identifier.
See if the iteration algorithms can be improved.
Get rid of (most of) MOStask and/or don't allocate it on the heap.
Make sure the parameters.bits fields are always char.
Use GDK naming conventions, e.g. o for stuff coming out if canditer_next.
Make block headers specific by having type parametrized blockheader struct's.(1)
