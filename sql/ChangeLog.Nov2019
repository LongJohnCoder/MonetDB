- There are new aggregate functions sys.median_avg and sys.quantile_avg
  that return the interpolated value if the median/quantile doesn't fall
  exactly on a particular row.  These functions always return a value
  of type DOUBLE and only work for numeric types (various width integers
  and floating point).

- Added sys.deltas ("schema" string, "table" string, "column" string)
  returns table ("values" bigint) system function which returns a single
  column with 6 values: a flag indicating if the column's upper table is
  cleared or not, the count of the RDONLY, RD_INS and RD_UPD_ID deltas
  of the column itself, the number of deleted values of the column's
  table, as well as the level of the current transaction in the
  transaction level tree. It should be used for debugging purposes only.

* Mon May  6 2019 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Added "VALUES row_list" statement as a top SQL projection statement.

- The implementation of in-expression now follows a join-based approach
  instead of using iterative union/selects. This greatly improves
  performance for large in-value-lists. Furthermore the old approach has
  large in-value-lists generate large MAL plans. This is now no longer
  the case.
