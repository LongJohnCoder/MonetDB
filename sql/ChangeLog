- Added sys.prepared_statements view, which depicts the available prepared
  statements in the current session.
- Added deallocate statements with the syntax 'DEALLOCATE [PREPARE]
  { number | ALL }', to close an existing prepared statement or all,
  through the SQL layer. Previously this feature was available via MAPI
  exclusively with the "release" command.

- Implemented ROLLUP, CUBE and GROUPING SETS from SQL:1999. They define
  grouping subsets used at GROUP BY clause in order to compute partial
  groupings. At the same time, the GROUPING aggregate was added. This
  aggregate is a bitmask identifying the grouping columns not present
  in the generated grouping row when used with the operators described
  above.

* Tue Nov 19 2019 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Updated user session procedures by adding te possibility to set properties
  based on a session identifier. The optimizer pipeline, number of worker
  threads and memory limits can be set per user session. As a consequence,
  the procedures sys.settimeout(bigint), sys.settimeout(bigint,bigint)
  and sys.session(bigint) are now deprecated.
