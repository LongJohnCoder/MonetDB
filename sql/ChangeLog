# ChangeLog file for sql
# This file is updated with Maddlog

- Updated user session procedures by adding te possibility to set properties
  based on a session identifier. The optimizer pipeline, number of worker
  threads and memory limits can be set per user session. As a consequence,
  the procedures sys.settimeout(bigint), sys.settimeout(bigint,bigint)
  and sys.session(bigint) are now deprecated.
